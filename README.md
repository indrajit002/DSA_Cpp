## Introduction

I am Indrajit Barman, a passionate learner and aspiring software developer. This repository is a reflection of my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through C++. It serves as a personal learning log and a resource for others who are also on the path of mastering DSA.

## Goals

- To gain a solid understanding of fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms.
- To improve problem-solving skills.
- To prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming.

## Resources

Here are some of the resources I've been using:

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Coding Ninjas](https://www.codingninjas.com/)
- [CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)

## Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

1. **Arrays**
2. **Linked Lists**
3. **Stacks and Queues**
4. **Trees**
5. **Graphs**
6. **Hashing**
7. **Dynamic Programming**
8. **Sorting and Searching**
9. **Bit Manipulation**

## Project Structure

```
.
├── Arrays
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── problems
│   │   ├── problem1.cpp
│   │   └── problem2.cpp
├── LinkedLists
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── problems
│   │   ├── problem1.cpp
│   │   └── problem2.cpp
├── Stacks
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── problems
│   │   ├── problem1.cpp
│   │   └── problem2.cpp
└── README.md
```

Each directory contains:

- A `README.md` file with explanations and insights about the topic.
- A `problems` directory with various problems and their solutions in C++.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-CPP-Journey.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the specific topic directory:**

   ```sh
   cd DSA-CPP-Journey/Arrays
   ```

3. **Open and review the problem files:**

   ```sh
   cat problems/problem1.cpp
   ```

4. **Compile and run the solution:**

   ```sh
   g++ -o problem1 problems/problem1.cpp
   ./problem1
   ```
